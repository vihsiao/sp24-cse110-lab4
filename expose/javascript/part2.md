1. it will print the length of the array 3
2. it will print 150, the final discount price from the last price element in the prices array
3. will print 150, the final discount price from the last price element in the prices array
4. it will return an array of the calculated discount prices given the input of the array of prices
5. throws an error because i is only defined in the scope of the for loop
6. throws an error because discountedPrice is only defined in the scope of the for loop
7. prints the final price of the last price element in the array (150)
8. it will return an array of the calculated discount prices given the input of the array of prices 
9. throws an error because i is only defined in the scope of the for loop
10. prints the length of the array 3
11. it will return an array of the calculated discount prices given the input of the array of prices, with arrays the const term will be valid because we are not reassigning the array nor does pushing elements gets flagged as an error even though array is updated

    A - student.name
    B - student["Grad Year"]
    C - student.greeting()
    D - student["Favorite Teacher"].name
    E - student.courseLoad[0]
13. 
    A - 32 (because the 2 is casted to a string so the operation ends up as string concatenation)
    B - 1 (because the 3 is casted to an int so the operation ends up as an integer operation)
    C - 3 (null is recognized as 0 in this operation so the operation turns to 3 + 0)
    D - 3null (null casted to a string based on '3' so this ends up as string concatenation)
    E - 4 (true as an int is 1 so it is casted to an int and the operation turns to 1 + 3)
    F - 0 (false as an int is 0 and null as an int is 0 so both are casted to ints and operation is 0 + 0)
    G - 3undefined (similar to '3' + null, undefined casted to a string and the operation is string concatenation)
    H - NaN (you cannot subtract a string with the undefined term because undefined term does not cast to an integer)
14. 
    A - true (because 2 casted to an int and comparison turns to 2 > 1)
    B - false ('1' is lexicographically smaller than '12', string comparisons compare based on which is lexicographically smaller)
    C - true (values are the same)
    D - false (types are not the same)
    E - false (true casts to 1 as an int, so comparison becomes 1 == 2)
    F - true (Boolean(2) is casted to true, any int other than 0 casted to a boolean is true, so comparison becomes true == true)
15. The === operator checks if the types between two values are the same along with the values of the two elements being compared, the == operator does not check for type
16. [2, 4, 6]. A for loop loops through the elements in the array ([1, 2, 3]), the array element is passed into the callback function (which is doSomething), in which the element is doubled and pushed into a new array. After the for loop looped through all elements in the array, the new array (in this case, [2, 4, 6]) is returned.
